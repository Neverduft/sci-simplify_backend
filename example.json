        "The proliferation of social networks and mobile devices with cameras has led to an explosive increase in the number of digital images. This has generated large personal photograph datasets for maintaining beautiful memories. However, the organization of an ideal personal album or collection manually from such massive number of images is onerous, and this task is always time-consuming and challenging. The major problem underlying this challenge is the accurate recognition of the personal aesthetic preference of different users. In this paper, we study how to automatically assess the aesthetic characteristics of images through taking into account the user's preference in a simple interactive way.",
        "The previous work mainly focus on hand-crafted visual features that all high-quality images may share. Extensive experiments have been conducted with low-level visual features and high-level features combinations. However, traditional hand-crafted visual features are limited and restrictive due to the following reasons: 1) These man-made visual features are the approximations of aesthetic rules, failing to fully capture the aesthetic abstract. 2) The universal visual features lack consideration for subjectivity and personal preference of different users. Recently, deep learning has been involved to evaluate the aesthetic quality of images. Compared with those traditional methods, the most notable difference is that the deep features of the input images could be extracted automatically without making any artificial approximations of the aesthetic rules. However, most of above work pay their attention on the task of binary classification without considering the subjectivity and personal preference of diverse individuals.",
        "To overcome the shortcomings of traditional hand-crafted visual features and the lack of consideration for personal preference in deep learning models, we propose a novel and interactive user-friendly aesthetic ranking framework called User-specific Aesthetic Ranking (USAR). Our framework consists of three modules: Primary Personalized Ranking (PPR), Interaction Stage (IS), and User-specific Aesthetic Distribution (USAD). In the module of PPR, a unique and exclusive dataset is constructed interactively to describe the preference of one individual by retrieving the most similar images specified by users. The powerful Deep Convolutional Neural Network is involved and optimized to retrieve these content similar images. Based on this unique user-specific dataset and well-designed aesthetic attributes, a customized aesthetic distribution model is learned in the module of USAD, which concatenates both personalized preference and photography rules.",
        "We conduct extensive experiments and user studies on two large-scale public datasets, and demonstrate that our framework outperforms other work based on conventional aesthetic assessment or ranking models. The contributions of this paper mainly focus on proposing a novel and user-friendly aesthetic ranking framework that can automatically rank the aesthetic quality of images in accordance with user's preference. We also propose an efficient and limited interactive method to construct a unique and exclusive dataset to represent the aesthetic preference of one individual. Additionally, we propose a customized aesthetic distribution model based on a unique user-specific dataset and well-designed aesthetic attributes, which concatenates both user's personalized preference and aesthetic rules.",
        "In conclusion, our proposed User-specific Aesthetic Ranking (USAR) framework provides a user-friendly and accurate approach to assess the aesthetic characteristics of images. By considering user's preference and interaction in the ranking process, our framework outperforms other methods based on conventional aesthetic assessment or ranking models. In the future, we aim to improve the efficiency of the refinement stage and explore stronger feature representations for the style-specific classifier. We also plan to further optimize the user-specific aesthetic distribution to achieve more accurate personalized aesthetic preferences.",
